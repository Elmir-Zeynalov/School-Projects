Quick App that models Co2 changes in the world.  
Basic idea is that temperature_plotter.py creates a plot of the changing Co2 levels over a given timespan and saves that in static. The app/website
then accesses static and grabs whatever image is stored there and displays it to the user.  
To run: python3> web_visualization.py
