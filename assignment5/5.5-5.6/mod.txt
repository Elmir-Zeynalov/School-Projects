Note that “line by line” is a bit misleading, as it is not enough to simply
compare the two files line by line.
Instead, you should try to find what the files
have in common, to try to find the minimal modifications
necessary to get the
“modified file”. There is however some ambiguity inherent to the problem. For
example, if the original has the lines “A”, “B”
and the modified version has the

lines “B”, “A”, was “A” deleted and later inserted, or was “B” inserted and
later deleted? There are a lot of strange edge cases,
so don’t be too worried
about making an implementation which handles absolutely all of them.
original is “A”, “B”, “C”, “D”, “E”, “F” and the modified file is “B”, “C”,
“D”, “E”, “F”, “G”, your program should ideally output that “A” has been
first file was deleted, then everything in the second file was inserted”.
